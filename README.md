# 2D-PUBG
Written with Java and libGDX, this is a 2D single player shooting game with gigantic map, similar to PUBG. Here you can shoot,
heal, and hide, just like the way you play the shooting game PUBG!

Rules are the same as PUBG: Defeat everyone to be the winner!  
Controls: "wasd" to move, "r" to reload, "1" or "2" to swap weapons, "3" or "4" to use first aid or bandage  

Notes:  

Read header comments in MyGdxGame.java for more details of the game  

Before playing this game, please ensure that you have already downloaded java and libGdX.

This game requires a computer's performance. If the hardware is not strong enough, it is more likely to lag. Sorry for this.

Feel free to edit and improve the game!

Enjoy.
